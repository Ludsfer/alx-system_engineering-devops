Create a magic file school.mgc that can be used with the command file to detect School data files. School data files always contain the string SCHOOL at offset 0.


- First add this command to the magic file, in this case "school.mgc" the following code

#!/bin/bash
0 string SCHOOL School data
!:mime School


- and grant it the 'execution permission' by running 

sudo chmod +x school.mgc



- Then run the following command on the command line

file -C -m school.mgc
